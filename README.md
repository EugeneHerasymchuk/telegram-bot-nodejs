# telegram-bot-node

Bot with aim to help people with their needs. 
One of the possible way to develop is to integrate bot with third-party API-s as a result use him as a helper to identify some info. 
Idea is to NOT use hardcode /messages and to communicate with user via AI algorithm.
TODO:
- [ ] router architecture for easy connection new services
- [ ] third-api integration 
- [ ] AI for analyzing user messages.

Ideas for third-party API-s: 
- film API [https://www.themoviedb.org/about]
- weather API
- mailing system
- dropbox API ( send file from chat to dropbox account ) - should use authentification.
